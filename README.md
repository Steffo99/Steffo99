## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Steffo!

I am a Computer Science master's student who enjoys finding optimal solutions to problems and publishing them as free software for everyone to use!

I'm particularly interested in Internet technologies, games, and user and developer experiences.

I often partecipate in [@RYGhub](https://github.com/RYGhub), and contribute knowledge and code where I see fit.

_Please respect my free time and do not contact me on Telegram for issues related to my repositories._
